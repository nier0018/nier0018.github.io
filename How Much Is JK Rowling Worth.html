  <p> The most recent source seems to come from this article by Forbes:
    THE SPELL CAST by Harry Potter on readers, now 20 years in its grip, seems unlikely to lift anytime soon.
    The seven-book series has sold more than 450 million copies worldwide; the movie franchise it spawned has grossed $7.7 billion.
    J.K. Rowling is now worth some $650 million, Forbes estimates, her fortune boosted by payouts from theme parks in Florida, California and Japan.
    <strong>That figure would be higher had she not donated an estimated $150 million to charity over the years.</strong>
    Yet still it climbs: Thanks to Harry Potter and the Cursed Child--a new London theatrical production and published script
    --plus Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a 2016 movie-and-script-book combo, Rowling banked $95 million in the 12 months to June 2017.
    Two decades on, she's releasing new work and cashing in on the old--lucrative dark arts indeed.
